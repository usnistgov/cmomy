### Changed

- Changed structure of the repo to better support some third party tools.
- Moved nox environments from `.nox` to `.nox/{project-name}/envs`. This fixes
  issues with ipykernel giving odd names for locally installed environments.
- Moved repo specific dot files to the `config` directory (e.g.,
  `.noxconfig.toml` to `config/userconfig.toml`). This cleans up the top level
  of the repo.
- added some support for using `nbqa` to run mypy/pyright on notebooks.
- Added ability to bootstrap development environment using pipx. This should
  simplify initial setup. See Contributing for more info.
