### Changed

- Switch to underlying numba functions using `guvectorize`. This significantly
  simplifies the code. Previously, we had separate functions for "vector" vs
  "scalar" moments. To handle arbitrary vector dimensions, the arrays were
  reshaped behind the scenes (to a single "meta" dimension). Now, this is all
  handled by the `gufunc` based library code.
- Typing support improved.
- Added `(x)CentralMoments.astype`
- Added `(x)CentralMoments.`
- Added alias `CentralMoments.to_x` which is the same as
  `CentralMoments.to_xcentralmoments`.
- Added alias `xCentralMoments.to_c` which is the same as
  `xCentralMoments.to_centralmoments`.
- Most constructors now accept `order` and `dtype` arguments.
- Most routines that process central moments accept a `parallel` parameter.
- Instead of complicated internal validation routines in `(x)CentralMoments`,
  most of this is now handled by `cmomy.reduction` or similar routines.
- Now using `xr.apply_ufunc` for most of the `xarray.DataArray` based
  calculations.

### Deprecated

- Removed classmethods `(x)CentralMoments.from_raws`. Instead, use
  `(x)CentralMoments.from_raw(...).reduce(...)`.
- Removed classmethods `(x)CentralMoments.from_datas`. Instead, use
  `(x)CentralMoments.from_data(...).reduce(...)`.
- Removed classmethod `(x)CentralMoments.from_data`. Instead, use
  `(x)CentralMoments(....)`.
- Removed ability to create `xCentralMoments` objects directly from
  `numpy.ndarray` objects. (e.g., passing in array-like to
  `xCentralmoments.from_vals` doesn't work anymore). Instead use
  `CentralMoments.from_vals(....).to_xcentralmoments(...)`, etc.
- Removed methods `push_stat`, `push_stats`, `from_stat`, `from_stats`. Instead
  use, for example, `numpy.concatenate`, to combine weights, average, and
  variance into a `data` array. A helper function may be added if called for.
- `(x)CentralMoments.resample_and_reduce` and
  `(x)CentralMoments.from_resample_vals` no longer accept `nrep=...` or
  `indices=...`. They only accept `freq=...`.
