### Changed

- Switch to underlying numba functions using `guvectorize`. This significantly
  simplifies the code. Previously, we had separate functions for "vector" vs
  "scalar" moments. To handle arbitrary vector dimensions, the arrays were
  reshaped behind the scenes (to a single "meta" dimension). Now, this is all
  handled by the `gufunc` based library code.

### Deprecated

- Removed classmethods `(x)CentralMoments.from_raws`. Instead, use
  `(x)CentralMoments.from_raw(...).reduce(...)`.
- Removed classmethods `(x)CentralMoments.from_datas`. Instead, use
  `(x)CentralMoments.from_data(...).reduce(...)`.
- Removed methods `push_stat`, `push_stats`, `from_stat`, `from_stats`. Instead
  use, for example, `numpy.concatenate`, to combine weights, average, and
  variance into a `data` array. A helper function may be added if called for.
