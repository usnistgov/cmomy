### Changed

- Can now resample with an arbitrary number of samples. Previously, it was
  assumed that resampling should be done with a shape `(nrep, ndat)`, where
  `nrep` is the number of replicates and `ndat` is the shape of the data along
  the resampled axis. Now you can pass sample with shape `(nrep, nsamp)` where
  `nsamp` is the specified number of samples in a replicate (defaulting to
  `ndat`). This allows users to do things like jacknife resampling, etc, with
  `resample_and_reduce` methods.
- Preliminary support for using type hints in generated documentation. The
  standard sphinx autodoc support doesn't quite work for `cmomy`, as it requires
  type hints to be accessible at run time, and not in `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks.
  Instead, we use
  [`sphinx_autodoc_type`](https://github.com/tox-dev/sphinx-autodoc-typehints).
  This has the downside of expanding type aliases, but handles (most things)
  being in `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks. Over time, we'll replace some of the explicit
  parameter type documentation with those from type hints.
- Fixed creation of templates in reduction routines of `xCentralMoments`.
  Previously, we build the template for the result using something like
  `da.isel(dim=0)`. This kept scalar coordinates of `da` with `dim`. Now we use
  `da.isel(dim=0, drop=True)` to drop these.
- Updated dependencies.
